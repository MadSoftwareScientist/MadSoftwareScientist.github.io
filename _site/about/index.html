<h2 id="about-this-website">About this website</h2>

<p>This website is all about science. In my blog posts, I write about AI, machine learning, quantum computing and software science in general. In the posts, I will tell about the results of applying software scientific methods and techniques into everyday things that are familiar to most of us. Sometimes my posts may also be about software development methodologies, software business or about science in general.</p>

<p>Posts in this blog will be written in a semi-academic manner and I will refer to sources I have used. I wrote semi-academic because the posts are not supposed to be, by any means, pure peer-reviewed scientific reports. Instead, I intend to write easily approachable way about interesting software science related topics and to apply those methods into everyday problems.</p>

<p>In the blog posts, there will be some mathematical expressions and code examples. Do not worry if you are not familiar with those. I will try to keep mathematics and code examples as light as possible. I will write posts so, that deep understanding of mathematics and programming will not be required from the reader. You may eye them through, but you do not have to understand them thoroughly to get the point.</p>

<p>You will see that applying software science into everyday things will sometimes result surprising and maybe even comical outcomes. Sometimes this approach may also give new ways to think about otherwise mundane topics. I will hope that you find this website and my blog posts entertaining. Who knows, maybe you learn a thing or two about software science at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>

<p>How about me? I am a software engineering professional with a master’s degree in software development and software science. I have over 10 years’ experience working in various positions in the software industry. Up to this point in my career, I have been a software developer, project manager, product owner, and procurement consultant. I am also team lead/manager and salesman ready to do business whenever I see a good opportunity.</p>

<p>Since a young child, I have been interested in mathematics, science and making business. I remember being about four years old asking my parents to teach me to calculate long division. To knowledge thirsty young me it was a real bummer to find out they were not able to teach me more complex math after that. When I learned to read, I borrowed a huge zoological book from my friend because I was decided to write a study about big cats. I never finished that study, but I sure did enjoy looking at those pictures about lions, tigers, and cheetahs.</p>

<p>This enthusiasm to study and understand, how things work, have followed me through life. Working in the software industry have offered me an excellent environment to learn new things. However, in work life, you cannot always do what you want, but what clients are ready to pay for. This blog gives me the opportunity to study and write about those things that clients are not ready to pay for.</p>
